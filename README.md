# Chikungunya Control: Leveraging Data Science with Python, Pandas, and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This data science project aims to combat the increasing threat of Chikungunya outbreaks, especially in regions like South America that have witnessed unexpected epidemics of arboviruses in the past decade. Arboviruses, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are transmitted to humans primarily by mosquitoes, with Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus being the main culprits.

### Background

In Brazil, the first detection of CHIKV occurred in September 2014, sparking outbreaks in different regions. The Asian genotype was identified in the northern state of Amap√°, while the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype was found in the northeastern state of Bahia. The term "chikungunya," derived from the Kimakonde language, translates to "to become contorted," referencing the intense joint pain characteristic of the disease.

### Disease Characteristics

Unlike the Zika virus, CHIKV infection is associated with recurring joint pain and a high incidence of symptomatic infections. The typical presentation includes a sudden onset of fever, rash, and joint pain, often accompanied by headaches. These symptoms can be easily confused with Zika virus symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis.

## Project Objectives

1. **Prediction:** Utilize the SEIR model to predict the potential spread of Chikungunya within affected populations.
2. **Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness of various control strategies to minimize the impact of Chikungunya outbreaks.

## Technologies Used

1. **Python:** Primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
2. **Pandas:** Facilitates data manipulation and preprocessing for seamless dataset integration.
3. **Machine Learning:** Fine-tunes SEIR model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
4. **SEIR Model:** Implemented to simulate the progression of Chikungunya in a population.
5. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Enables interactive data exploration, analysis, and model visualization.
6. **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Utilized for creating insightful visualizations of model outputs and predictions.
7. **Scikit-learn:** Applied for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
8. **NumPy:** Supports numerical operations and array manipulations in the data science pipeline.
9. **Scipy:** Utilized for scientific and technical computing, enhancing statistical analysis.
10. **Geospatial Analysis Tools:** Incorporate tools like GeoPandas and Folium for mapping and visualizing spatial data.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to interactively explore data, run analyses, and visualize model outputs.
3. Adjust parameters and experiment with different scenarios for Chikungunya control.

This project aims not only to predict Chikungunya spread but also to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different control strategies. By leveraging data science, we strive to contribute to proactive and informed public health management in regions susceptible to arbovirus outbreaks.
